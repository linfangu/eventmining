# Eventmining
The eventmining project using data from dyadic animals interacting in the tube test and open arena. 
## file description 
### Pre-processing 
* Signal Transformation 

Comparison of signal normalization using continuous, continuous at 90% maximum, binary transformations.
* cor_dist_map 

Correlation-distance map that is used to determine cell contamination to be removed 
### Eventmining
* Eventmining 18p 

18 pairs tube test event mining with continuous(maximum 90%) or binary transformation 

* Eventmining arena 10p 

10 pairs open arena event mining with continuous(maximum 90%) or binary transformation 
* anti_event 18p 

18 pairs tube test ANTI-event mining with continuous(maximum 90%) or binary transformation 
* anti_event arena 10p 

10 pairs open arena ANTI-event mining with continuous(maximum 90%) or binary transformation 
* All_events

Alignment of 1st and 2nd round events and anti-events to behaviours and trial onsets 
### Cell sorting 
* clustering method

Comparison of neuron clustering methods to visualize population structures in the signal 
* sort_2_mouse 

Concatenate cells from a pair of mice together and perform cell clustering to visualize inter-brain population structures.
